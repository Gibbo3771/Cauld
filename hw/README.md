# Weather forecaster

A simple web-app that is built using Javascript and Lit-html to serve the HTML. This was built as part of week 7 of my Codeclan course,
I however decided to take it a bit further and incorporate full ES6 support transpiled with babel with webpack as the builder.

In order to get this application to work, you will have to first get an API key from [APIXU](https://www.apixu.com/)

## TODO

Write details how to get API key into app.
